ABOUT

MM-NEAT stands for Multiobjective Modular Neuro-Evolution of Augmenting Topologies.
It is inspired by the original NEAT, but also incorporates multiobjective evolution
via NSGA-II, and supports several forms of modular neural networks. Support for
the fitness shaping technique Targeting Unachieved Goals (TUG) is also included.
Indirect encoding via HyperNEAT is also supported. The code was developed by 
Jacob Schrum (schrum2@southwestern.edu) while at the University of Texas at Austin. 
Dr. Schrum is now a professor at Southwestern University in Georgetown, TX.
Links to publications and demos further explaining the code are available at 
the official webpage:

Augmenting Topologies." Evolutionary Computation, 10(2):99-127, 2002.

sorting genetic algorithm for multi-objective optimization: NSGA-II".

A precursor to MM-NEAT is the BREVE Monsters software package, available at:

http://nn.cs.utexas.edu/?brevemonsters

This code was developed primarily to evolve multimodal behavior in Ms. Pac-Man,
and therefore includes (modified) code for the Ms. Pac-Man simulator created for
the Ms. Pac-Man vs. Ghosts Competitions. The original version of this code does not
seem to be available anymore, but a newer version associated with the latest competition
can be downloaded at:

For further instructions on how to run this code, see TUTORIAL.txt.
